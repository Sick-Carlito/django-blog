# Django Blog â€” Portfolio Project

A full-featured blog platform built with **Django**. This project is a learning and portfolio project focused on building a secure, deployable, SEO-friendly blog that can be monetized with ads and affiliates and showcased to clients or employers.

   - Categories, tags, comments, and admin management.
   - SEO best-practices: friendly slugs, sitemaps, meta tags, OpenGraph.
   - Responsive, accessible frontend (mobile-first).
2. Learn and document a complete web app workflow:
   - Local development with virtualenv and environment variables.
   - Testing (TDD), migrations, and database setup.
   - Deployment to a hosting provider with HTTPS, static/media handling.
3. Portfolio & Documentation:
   - Maintain clear documentation and a case study showing architecture, deployment, and SEO results.
